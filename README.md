## [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning](https://github.com/joaolucasmiqueleto/courses/tree/main/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning)
The 'Feature Engineering for Machine Learning' course is offered by Dr. Soledad Galli and can be accessed on the following page: [Feature Engineering for Machine Learning - Soledad Galli](https://www.trainindata.com/p/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning). The course includes a repository containing class notebooks, which are available on Galli's GitHub. The repository can be found at the following link: [Repo for the Course](https://github.com/solegalli/feature-engineering-for-machine-learning). My goal with this repository is to transcribe my class notes into notebooks. It does not include any innovative content and serves as a direct transcription of the original classes, which can be found at the aforementioned link.
